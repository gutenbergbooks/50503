FORTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT

OF THE

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

M. W. STIRLING, CHIEF


The operations of the Bureau of American Ethnology during the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1931, were conducted in accordance with the act
of Congress approved April 19, 1930, making appropriations for sundry
civil expenses of the Government, which act contains the following item:

    American ethnology: For continuing ethnological researches
    among the American Indians and the natives of Hawaii, the
    excavation and preservation of archeologic remains under the
    direction of the Smithsonian Institution, including necessary
    employees, the preparation of manuscripts, drawings, and
    illustrations, the purchase of books and periodicals, and
    traveling expenses, $70,280.



SYSTEMATIC RESEARCHES

M. W. Stirling, chief, left Washington during the latter part of
January to continue his archeological researches in Florida. On the way
south he took the opportunity to investigate a number of archeological
sites in several of the Southern States, notably a group of mounds
which had been reported in the vicinity of High Point, N. C. and two
mound sites on Pine Island in the Tennessee River in northern Alabama.

A few days were spent in the vicinity of Montgomery, Ala., examining
the early historic sites being investigated there by the Alabama
Anthropological Society. A large mound had been reported in the
vicinity of Flomaton, Ala.; this was visited and found to be a natural
formation.

Continuing down the west coast of Florida, Mr. Stirling visited briefly
the archeological sites at Crystal River, Safety Harbor, and Alligator
Creek. The principal work for the season was commenced on February 5
on Blue Hill Island south of Key Marco, one of the northernmost of
the Ten Thousand Island Group. A large sand burial mound was excavated
and found to be of early post-Columbian Calusa origin. Excavation of
the mound disclosed a number of interesting structural features quite
unusual in Florida sand mounds. Six feet above the base of the mound a
clay floor was encountered which gave evidence of having been the base
of a temple structure, as it was surrounded by post-holes and in some
instances by the decayed remains of the wooden uprights still in place.
This structure had evidently been destroyed and the mound subsequently
enlarged by adding 6 feet more of sand above the original substructure.
Numerous burials were encountered both above and below the clay floor.
A few articles of European manufacture were recovered from the upper
level of the mound. As none were recovered from beneath the temple
floor, it is possible that the older section of the mound is of
pre-Columbian age. Cultural material recovered was interesting though
not abundant. This included characteristic pottery specimens, pendants
and ornaments made from fossil shark teeth, shell dishes, cups, celts,
and a few stone knives and arrowheads. Articles of European manufacture
consisted of glass beads and iron axes of Spanish type. More than 250
burials were removed.

Following the completion of this work, Mr. Stirling went to the island
of Haiti, where, in the company of H. W. Krieger, of the United States
National Museum, he investigated archeological sites previously worked
by Mr. Krieger in various parts of the island. Returning from Haiti to
Florida, work was continued in the eastern part of the State, where a
number of mounds were investigated between Miami and Cape Canaveral.

The most interesting discovery of the entire season consisted in
locating two series of large geometric earthworks on the eastern side
of the Everglades, not far from Indian town. One of these groups is
one of the largest and best preserved works of this type now existing
on the North American continent. It is hoped that at an early date
the bureau will be able to begin excavations on this most interesting
site. At the completion of this reconnaissance, Mr. Stirling returned
to Washington, leaving almost immediately for Chicago in order to
attend a meeting of the National Research Council, the purpose of which
was to organize research on the subject of early man in America.

Dr. John R. Swanton, ethnologist, was engaged in field work in
Louisiana from July 1 to August 14, 1930. It was found that Rosa
Pierrette, the sole Indian acquainted with the Ofo language and the one
from whom, in 1908, he obtained the only specimens of that language in
existence, was dead, and the language therefore is dead also. A search
was made for speakers of Atakapa, but all appeared to be gone except
one old woman who could barely recall a few words. The Chitimacha
Indians of Charenton were visited and a small amount of linguistic
material was obtained from them. Of the Tunica at Marksville, only two
or three are still able to use the old tongue, but one of these proved
to be an ideal informant and Doctor Swanton obtained from him a number
of short stories and one long story in native text. The rest of the
time was spent at Kinder, where a considerable body of material in
Koasati was obtained.

In view of the extinction of Atakapa as a spoken language, Doctor
Swanton considered that the words, phrases, and text collected by Dr.
A. S. Gatschet in 1886, which comprise by far the greater portion
of the material in that tongue still preserved, should be published
without delay and the greater part of the winter of 1930-31 was spent
in editing it. To Gatschet’s material have been added the Eastern
Atakapa words collected by Murray and the Akokisa vocabulary obtained
by the French captain, Bérenger, and published by Du Terrage and Rivet.
A bulletin containing all this is now in the hands of the printer.

Work has progressed on the tribal map of North America which is being
copied by Mrs. E. C. M. Payne, and additions have been made to the text
to accompany it.

Doctor Swanton is preparing the first draft of a Handbook of the
Indians of the Southeast.

The closing weeks of the year were devoted to reading the proof of
Bulletin 103, entitled “Source Material for the Social and Ceremonial
Life of the Choctaw Indians.”

Dr. Truman Michelson, ethnologist, was at work among the Kickapoo of
Oklahoma at the beginning of the fiscal year. A really representative
body of Kickapoo mythology is now available, and it is quite certain
that it is more northern than Fox mythology. The ritualistic origin
myths are still terra incognita. A good beginning has been made on
Kickapoo social organization. In the middle of July Doctor Michelson
went among the Foxes of Iowa. The object of the trip was to restore
one Fox text phonetically and to obtain some new texts, in the current
syllabic script, on Fox ceremonials, in both of which projects he
was successful. Doctor Michelson returned to Washington August 4. He
completed his memoir on the Fox WâpAnōwiweni and transmitted
it for publication February 7. His paper, Contributions to Fox
Ethnology, II, Bulletin 95 of the bureau, appeared in the course of the
fiscal year.

The remainder of the time was largely taken up studying materials
gathered previously and also in extracting from Petter’s Cheyenne
Dictionary such stems and words as can be rigorously proved to be
Algonquian. The material on the physical anthropology of the Cheyenne
showed clearly the great variation that occurs among living races. A
proper technique was worked out for determining the Cheyenne words
of Algonquian origin. Though Petter’s alphabet is inadequate, it was
possible to partially control this material by comparing it with
that of Doctor Michelson. Approximately 700 of such words and stems
were extracted. Though the technique mentioned above is very slow,
Doctor Michelson is convinced that it is the correct procedure. It was
entirely feasible to establish about 70 phonetic shifts which have
transformed Cheyenne from normal Algonquian into divergent Algonquian.

Toward the close of May Doctor Michelson left for Oklahoma and renewed
his work with the Cheyenne of that State. He restored phonetically the
material extracted from Petter, with the result that it is now possible
to formulate the transforming phonetic shifts with greater nicety.
He also measured a number of Cheyenne. Though the number is not yet
large enough to be absolutely decisive in a statistical sense, there
is good reason to believe that the vault of their skulls is low, thus
resembling the Dakota Sioux rather than most Algonquian tribes. Some
new data on Cheyenne social life and mythology were obtained. It was
his privilege to consult with some other anthropologists in Oklahoma
and to visit one museum.

John P. Harrington, ethnologist, was engaged during the summer of
1930 in the preparation of his report on the Indians who were brought
together at San Juan Bautista Mission in the first half of the
nineteenth century by the Spanish-speaking padres from various parts
of San Benito County, Calif., and the adjacent region. A valuable
vocabulary of the language, recorded by Father Felipe Arroyo de la
Cuesta, had already been published by the Smithsonian Institution
in the sixties of the last century, but aside from this vocabulary
there was little or nothing in print on these Indians. Elaborating a
wealth of material obtained from Mrs. Ascención Solórsano, the last
San Juan Indian who spoke the language, who died in January, 1930,
Mr. Harrington prepared a report on all phases of the life of these
Indians, as far as reconstructable. This report tells of the remarkable
way in which the language and partial ethnography were rescued from
this sole survivor, and then proceeds to the history, geography, and
customs of the tribe, including all that could be learned of former
religion, ceremony, and mythology.

Mrs. Solórsano was an Indian herb doctor, and a feature of the work
during the summer of 1929 had been to obtain specimens and information
to cover the ethnobotany of the tribe. Further specimens were obtained
in the summer of 1930 by Mrs. Dionisia Mondragón and Miss Marta J.
Herrera, daughter and granddaughter of Mrs. Solórsano, and these were
all identified by Mr. C. V. Morton, of the National Herbarium. This
section gives the treatment for curing some 60 different ailments with
these herbs and by other curious means. It forms a nucleus for making
comparative studies in Indian medicine.

At the end of January, 1931, Mr. Harrington left for California for
the purpose of continuing his studies in this region, this time
specializing on the Esselen and Antoniano Indians in the southern part
of Monterey County. Taking the specimens of San Juan Bautista plants
with him and arriving in wild-flower season, a thorough collecting of
plants was rewarded with a great mass of information which further
elucidated much of the San Juan plant material. This collecting was
done in several places in southern Monterey County and simultaneously
in San Benito County. Seeds used for food were actually made up into
the food product to get the primitive process, and the same method was
followed in the study of medicines.

Along with the plants the field of ethnozoology was thoroughly covered
and practically all the animals known to these Indians were identified.
Specimens were obtained, especially of birds, which proved to be the
most difficult field for identification in the collecting of animal
names, and the skins were identified by the division of birds of the
National Museum. Eight different kinds of snakes were known by name and
identified.

One of the rarest features of the work was the obtaining of a number
of old Indian place names in the Old Esselen country, the western
tributary of the Salinas River known as the Arroyo Seco. A study of
the place names resulted in the discovery that the Esselen were not a
coastal but an inland people, inhabiting the Arroyo Seco and a section
of the Salinas River and centered about Soledad Mission. They were one
of the smallest tribes in California, and the name properly begins with
an h; they were known in the San Juan Bautista from all that section of
California. The expedition went from Monterey to the Aguage de Martin
and from there climbed the mountain. Some 40 exposures were made of
the various rocks connected with the ceremonies and the springs and
camps, and several hundred pages of notes were taken down in California
Spanish from Don Angel and others dealing with the history of these
ceremonies and the life of Mariana and Joaquin Murrieta. On the way
back to the coast the Cruz Cervantes ranch was visited, where Murrieta
and Mariana were equipped by Don Cruz for starting their war against
the Americans.

An examination of place names and village sites and linguistic
studies occupied Mr. Harrington up to the end of June. Not only were
vocabularies of early recording utilized but the invaluable records
contained in the old mission books were, through the courtesy of
Bishop McGinley, of Fresno, placed at the disposal of the Smithsonian
Institution for copying, and a considerable part of these books has
already been copied and revised with the aid of the oldest Indians.

Dr. F. H. H. Roberts, jr., archeologist, devoted the fiscal year to a
number of activities. During the months of July, August, and September,
excavations at a site on the Zuñi reservation, 16 miles northeast of
the Indian village of Zuñi, were brought to a conclusion. The work had
been started the latter part of May, 1930. At the end of the season’s
field work the ruins of two houses, one containing 64 rooms, the other
20 rooms, and a number of ceremonial chambers had been cleared of the
débris which had accumulated in them in the centuries which have passed
since their abandonment.

Evidence showed that the largest of the houses had not been erected as
a complete unit and that it was not occupied in its entirety at any
time. The central block, together with a superceremonial chamber placed
at its southern side, constituted the original block of the structure.
Subsequent additions consisted of an east-and-west wing and a series of
chambers south of the original portion and east of the great ceremonial
chamber. Masonry in the walls of the latter portions was inferior to
that in the original section. The outlines of the rooms in these same
portions of the building were so irregular that they appeared to have
been built by a different group of people. The walls in the original
section were constructed in a style characteristic of the ruins in the
Chaco Canyon, 85 miles northeast from the Zuñi region. The stonework in
the latter portions of the building was suggestive of the type found in
the ruins of the Upper Gila area to the south.

The small house did not give evidence of growth stages as distinct as
those observed in the large building; it did show, however, that a
fairly small structure had been added to on various occasions. The
walls in this building were of the same nature as those in the later
portions of the larger dwelling, except that the stones were more
carefully dressed. This suggested that the small house may have been
built by the same group which erected the later portions of the large
one.

In addition to the two houses and seven small ceremonial chambers two
great kivas were found. Only one of these was excavated. In the case
of the other it was possible merely to trace the outer walls in order
to obtain the size and position of the structure. The finding of these
two great kivas was significant because investigations in the Southwest
have shown that such structures are always associated with some form
of the Chaco culture. The great kiva connected with the larger of the
two dwellings revealed one of the essential characteristics of such
structures when the débris which filled it was removed. It had an
average diameter of 55 feet. The second of these large circular houses
was completely detached from the other buildings in the village and had
been placed in a court formed by the other structures. It averaged 78
feet in diameter, which makes it the largest yet discovered.

The excavations yielded 400 specimens of the people’s handicraft in
addition to the information on house types. Included in the collection
are pottery vessels, tools or implements of stone and bone, ornaments,
and a number of stone images. The pottery is characterized by examples
typical of the Chaco Canyon wares and also specimens characteristic
of the Upper Gila region to the south. The summer’s investigations
demonstrate that the village on the Zuñi reservation belongs to the
great period of the prehistoric pueblos; that designated as Pueblo III
in southwestern chronology. The evidence obtained also indicates that
there was a fusion of two groups of people at this location: One, the
first to arrive, came from the Chaco area in the north, and the other
from the Upper Gila villages in the south. Charred timbers obtained
from the ruins enabled Dr. A. E. Douglas, of the University of Arizona,
to give the dates 1000 to 1030 A. D. for the life of the community.

Upon the completion of the above work one week was spent in making an
archeological survey on the Zuñi reservation and in the region west
and northwest from that district. As a result of the reconnaissance, a
promising site for further investigations was found. Following this,
a trip was made to Cortez, Colo., for the purpose of inspecting ruins
being excavated by Lee Dawson near the opening into McElmo Canyon,
4 miles southwest from Cortez. It was found that Mr. Dawson had an
unusually interesting group of unit-type houses on his property. Of
particular interest were the kivas or ceremonial chambers associated
with these structures. In many of them the walls had been ornamented
with a series of paintings placed in bands encircling the walls. From
Cortez the writer went to Denver and from there returned to Washington
the middle of October.

During the winter months, galley, page, and final proofs were read on
Bulletin 100, a report on work conducted during the summer of 1929,
entitled “The Ruins of Kiatuthlanna, Eastern Arizona.” In addition, the
specimens brought in from the summer field work were studied. Drawings
and photographs were made of them for use in a report on the work. Six
hundred pages of manuscript, entitled “The Village of the Great Kivas
on the Zuñi Reservation, New Mexico,” was prepared. Thirty text figures
were drawn to accompany this manuscript.

Doctor Roberts left Washington May 14, 1931, for Denver, Colo., for
the purpose of inspecting and studying the specimens obtained by the
Smithsonian Institution-University of Denver Cooperative Expedition in
the summer of 1930 and also for the purpose of examining collections
in the Colorado State Museum. He left Denver on May 25 for Santa
Fe, N. Mex. At the latter place two days were spent in studying the
collections at the Laboratory of Anthropology and at the Museum of New
Mexico. From Santa Fe he proceeded to Gallup, N. Mex., where supplies
were obtained for a field camp. From Gallup this material was taken to
a site 3½ miles south of Allan town, Ariz., where a camp was established
and excavations started on the remains of a large pit-house village.
One refuse mound containing 12 burials with accompanying mortuary
offerings and two pit houses had been investigated at the close of the
fiscal year.

The pit houses were found to be characteristic of that type and quite
comparable to those excavated in the Chaco Canyon in 1927, reported in
Bulletin 92 of the Bureau of American Ethnology, and to those excavated
in eastern Arizona in the summer of 1929, described in Bulletin 100 of
the bureau.

From July 1, 1930, to May 10, 1931, J. N. B. Hewitt, ethnologist, was
engaged in routine office work, and from the latter date to the end of
the fiscal year he was engaged in field service on the Grant of the Six
Nations on the Grand River in Ontario, Canada, and, briefly, on the
Tuscarora reservation in western New York State.

Mr. Hewitt devoted much time and study to rearranging and retyping some
of his native Iroquoian texts which critical revisions and additional
data had made necessary to facilitate interlinear translations and to
render such texts as legible as possible for the printer.

The texts so treated are the Cayuga version of the founding of the
League of the Iroquois as dictated by the late Chief Abram Charles;
the version of the Eulogy of the Founders as dictated by Chief Jacob
Hess in Cayuga, and also his versions of the addresses introducing
the several chants; also, four of the myths of the Wind and Vegetable
Gods which are usually represented by wooden faces and husk faces
(which are customarily misnamed masks, although their chief purpose
is to represent, not to mask). The Onondaga texts of these myths were
in great need of careful revision, for their relator was extremely
careless in his use of the persons and the tenses of the verbs,
frequently changing from the third to the second person and from
past to future time by unconsciously employing the language of the
rites peculiar to the faces; and also the decipherment of a set of
pictographs or mnemonic figures, designed and employed by the late
Chief Abram Charles, of the Grand River Reservation in Canada, to
recall to his mind the official names and their order of the 49 federal
chiefs of the Council of the League of the Iroquois, in chanting the
Eulogy of the Founders of the League; and also to recall the 15
sections or burdens of the great Requickening Address of the Council of
Condolence and Installation; this paper with illustrations is nearly
ready for the printer; and also a critical study of the matter of the
Onondaga and the Cayuga texts, giving the several variant versions of
the events attending the birth and childhood and work of Deganawida.
He was born of a virgin mother, which indicated that underlying them
there appeared to be an ideal figure, although of course unexpressed.
This discovery showed the need for thorough search in the field for
a living tradition in which this ideal is fully expressed. Further
search was deferred to field work. It was clear that such an ideal
enhanced the beauty of the birth story of Deganawida and made more
interesting the historicity of such a person. Mr. Hewitt had the great
satisfaction of recovering such a tradition in his subsequent field
researches. He found that the inferiority complex had precluded his
present informants from expressing themselves during the lifetime of
other informants, whose recent deaths opened their mouths without the
fear of contradiction. The death of Abram Charles within the year made
these shy informants vocal.

In January Matthew W. Stirling, chief of the Bureau of American
Ethnology, requested Mr. Hewitt to undertake the editing of the
Manuscript Journal of Rudolph Friederich Kurz, of Berne, Switzerland,
in the manner in which he had prepared the Edwin Thompson Denig Report
on the Indian Tribes of the Upper Missouri River, published in the
Forty-sixth Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology. The
Kurz manuscript was written in German during the years 1846 to 1852.
The typed German text consists of 454 pages of large legal-cap size,
while the English translation of it by Myrtis Jarrell occupies 780
pages. The journal is a narrative of Mr. Kurz’s experiences in a trip
up the Mississippi River from New Orleans to St. Louis, thence up the
Missouri to Fort Union at the mouth of the Yellowstone River, and of
his difficulties with the Indians while endeavoring to make drawings
or pictures of them. There are 125 pen sketches of Indians and others
accompanying the manuscript.

Mr. Hewitt represents the Bureau of American Ethnology, Smithsonian
Institution, on the United States Geographic Board, and is a member
of its executive committee. In connection with the forthcoming issue
of the sixth report of this board much extra work had to be done by
members of the executive committee. Mr. Hewitt prepared a memorandum
for a portion of the introduction. Mr. Hewitt also devoted much time
and study to the collection and preparation of data for official
replies to correspondents of the bureau, some demanding long research.
Miss Mae W. Tucker has assisted Mr. Hewitt in the care of the
manuscript and phonograph and photograph records of the archives.

On May 10, 1931, Mr. Hewitt left Washington, D. C., on field duty and
returned to the bureau July 2, 1931. During this trip he visited the
Grand River grant of the Six Nations of Iroquois Indians dwelling near
Brantford, Canada, and also the Tuscarora Reservation near Niagara
Falls, N. Y.

Winslow M. Walker was appointed to the staff of the Bureau of American
Ethnology as associate anthropologist in March, 1931. He resumed his
research in Hawaiian archeology, begun during a year’s stay in the
Hawaiian Islands in 1929, in preparation for a paper on Hawaiian
sculpture.

In preparation for work in the field Mr. Walker undertook research
in the early narratives of exploration in Louisiana and Arkansas. He
left Washington May 29 to investigate some caves in the vicinity of
Gilbert, Ark., in the Ozark Mountains, with the hope of being able to
throw new light on the Ozark bluff dwellers and other early inhabitants
of the caves. Sixteen caves were explored and excavations were made
in several of the most promising. A large cave at Cedar Grove yielded
several skeletons and a considerable number of stone, flint, and bone
artifacts. As the fiscal year closed Mr. Walker was still engaged in
excavating this cavern. He intends to make a brief survey of certain
mounds and village sites along the Red River Valley in the northern
part of Louisiana on the completion of his work in Arkansas.


SPECIAL RESEARCHES

The study of Indian music for the Bureau of American Ethnology has
been carried forward during the past year by Miss Frances Densmore.
The three phases of this research are (1) the recording of songs and
collecting of other material in the field, including the purchase
of specimens; (2) the transcription and analysis of songs, with the
development of information; and (3) the preparation of material for
publication. All these phases have received attention during the year,
and the songs of three hitherto unstudied localities have been recorded.

Early in July, 1930, Miss Densmore went to Grand Portage, an isolated
Chippewa village on Lake Superior, near the Canadian boundary. This
village was visited in 1905, a ceremony was witnessed, and one of
its songs written down; therefore a return to Grand Portage was
particularly interesting. The purpose of the trip was to witness the
Chippewa dances on the Fourth of July, but she remained more than three
weeks, continuing her study of native customs. Several songs of the
_Wabunowin_ were heard and translated, these resembling the songs of
the Grand Medicine, which formed a subject of intensive study during
1907-1911. She also witnessed the tipi-shaking of an Indian medicine
man and listened to his songs for almost an hour. This performance is
very rare at the present time. Although the evening was quiet, the
tipi was seen to sway as though buffeted by a tempest, then remain
motionless a few seconds and again shake convulsively. This was
continuous while Miss Densmore watched the performance and was said
to have continued several hours afterwards. Inside the tipi sat the
medicine man, believed to be talking with spirits whom he had summoned,
the spirits making known their presence by the shaking of the conical
structure. The next day the medicine man said that he had summoned
the spirits in order to ascertain whether his treatment of a certain
sick man would be successful. He said that if the spirits “spoke loud
and clear” the man would recover, but if their voices were faint the
man would die. The response was said to have been satisfactory, and
accordingly he instituted a “beneficial dance,” which was attended by
Miss Densmore, and the songs heard for a considerable time. These,
like the songs in the tipi, resembled the songs of the Chippewa Grand
Medicine Society.

The study of Indian music was continued by a trip to Kilbourn, Wis.,
during August and September. Two pageants are given simultaneously at
the Dalles of the Wisconsin River, near Kilbourn, each employing about
100 Indians. In the pageants the swan and hoop dance, as well as war
and social dances of the Winnebago, were seen. The dances of other
tribes presented in the pageants included the eagle dance and other
pueblo dances. Songs of the swan, hoop, and frog dances were later
recorded by leading pageant singers.

At Kilbourn Miss Densmore recorded numerous songs of Pueblo Indians
from Isleta and Cochiti, these consisting chiefly of corn-grinding and
war songs. The words of these songs are highly poetic and many of the
melodies resemble Acoma songs in structure.

As John Bearskin and his family were traveling from Kilbourn to their
home in Nebraska they passed through Red Wing, Minn., and songs were
recorded at Miss Densmore’s home. Bearskin recorded three complete sets
of the Winnebago medicine lodge songs and a set of Buffalo feast songs.

In January, 1931, Miss Densmore went to Washington, where she worked on
the preparation of material for publication, and proceeded thence to
Miami, Fla., where she began a study of Seminole music, recording songs
of the corn dance from the man who leads the singing in that ceremony;
also the songs that precede a hunting expedition. The customs of the
Seminole were studied and a collection of specimens was obtained. This
collection includes two complete costumes and is now the property of
the United States National Museum.

The second phase of the research is represented by eight manuscripts
which include the transcriptions and analyses of 77 songs and two
flute melodies recorded by Winnebago, Isleta, Cochiti, and Seminole
Indians. The cumulative analyses of Indian songs has been continued and
now comprises 1,553 songs. The 14 tables submitted during this year
constitute a comparison between a large series of Nootka and Quileute
songs and the songs previously analyzed by the same method.

The third phase of work comprised the preparation for publication of
“Menominee Music” and “Acoma Music.”

Frank M. Setzler, assistant curator, division of archeology, United
States National Museum, was detailed to the bureau for the purpose
of conducting an archeological investigation in Texas. After briefly
examining several sites at Victoria and Brownsville along the Gulf
coast, he excavated four caves and one rock shelter on the Mollie B.
Knight ranch, in Presidio County, and visited several other caverns in
the vicinity.

From one large cave a total of 70 specimens, including baskets,
matting, cradles, sandals, beads, corn, gourd shards, and one skeleton,
were recovered. No pottery or evidence of European influence was found.
Although the site is only 150 miles east of a marginal Basket-Maker
culture, no local trace was found of these early southwestern people.
The material differs in some respects from any other in the Museum and
more research will be required before it can be definitely identified.

DISTRIBUTION OF PUBLICATIONS

The distribution of the publications of the bureau has been continued
under the charge of Miss Helen Munroe, assisted by Miss Emma B. Powers.
Publications distributed were as follows:

  Annual Report volumes and separates               6,003
  Bulletins and separates                          13,924
  Contributions to North American Ethnology            33
  Miscellaneous publications                          515
                                                   ------
         Total                                     20,475

As compared with the fiscal year ended June 30, 1930, there was a
decrease of 4,393. This decrease is mainly in the distribution of
bulletins and separates, and possibly is largely explained by the very
large number of separates from the Handbook which were sent in the
previous year to the many groups of Camp Fire Girls. No great demand
from any one group was received during the past fiscal year.

Twenty-eight addresses were added to the mailing list during the year
and 20 were taken off. The mailing list now stands at 1,635 in addition
to the members of the staff of the bureau and other branches of the
Institution who receive the publications regularly as issued.

During the early part of the calendar year Miss Mae W. Tucker was
detailed to this branch to assist in listing and cataloguing the great
collection of Indian negatives already classified by Mr. Gill in
previous years. Of the purely ethnologic subjects, including portraits,
arts, and industries, the list will embrace more than 7,000 units. This
work, so long delayed, has progressed most satisfactorily.


LIBRARY

The reference library has continued under the care of Miss Ella Leary,
librarian, assisted by Thomas Blackwell.

During the year 600 volumes were accessioned, of which 97 were
acquired by purchase, 100 by binding of periodicals, and 403 by
gift and exchange; also 190 pamphlets and 3,500 serials, chiefly
the publications of learned societies, were received and recorded,
of which 28 were obtained by purchase, the remainder being received
through exchange, giving us at the close of the year a working library
of 26,671 volumes, 16,717 pamphlets, and several thousand unbound
periodicals. Books loaned during the year numbered 975 volumes. During
the year 473 volumes were bound. In addition to the use of its own
library, which is becoming more valuable through exchange and by
limited purchase, it was found necessary to draw on the Library of
Congress for the loan of about 250 volumes, and in turn the bureau
library was frequently consulted by officers of other Government
establishments, as well as by students not connected with the
Smithsonian Institution. The purchase of books and periodicals has
been restricted to such as relate to the bureau’s researches. During
the year the cataloguing has been carried on as new accessions were
acquired and good progress was made in cataloguing ethnologic and
related articles in the earlier serials. The catalogue was increased by
the addition of 3,500 cards. A considerable amount of reference work
was done in the usual course of the library’s service to investigators
and students, both in the Smithsonian Institution and outside.

MISCELLANEOUS

The correspondence and other clerical work of the office has been
conducted by Miss May S. Clark, clerk to the chief, assisted by Anthony
W. Wilding, clerk. Miss Mae W. Tucker, stenographer, was engaged in
copying manuscript material for Doctor Swanton and in assisting Mr.
Hewitt in his work as custodian of manuscripts and phonograph records.
The manuscript Dictionary of * * * Indian Languages of North, Central,
and South America and the West Indies, compiled by W. R. Gerard, which
was in danger of becoming illegible due to the frayed condition of the
paper on which it was written and the faded writing, has been copied
by Miss Tucker. Work was begun on the catalogue of the photographic
negatives belonging to the bureau. To date approximately 7,000
negatives have been listed.

During the course of the year information was furnished by members
of the staff in reply to numerous inquiries concerning the North
American Indians, both past and present, and the Mexican peoples of the
prehistoric and early historic periods to the south. Various specimens
sent to the bureau were identified and data on them furnished for their
owners.

PREFACE


To the cultural anthropologist, as also to the archeologist, the United
States of America offer an unusually rich field in being a region where
civilized and primitive races exist side by side, where languages
belonging to totally different linguistic stocks are still spoken
by isolated tribes differing from each other in their cultural and
physical aspects, and where traces of lost civilizations indicating the
antiquity of man are being unearthed every day. The Bureau of American
Ethnology, since its beginning in 1879, has attempted to preserve these
ancient records for posterity; and its annual reports are a veritable
storehouse of information on languages and customs of tribes, many of
whom have already disappeared and others are fast disappearing. In
fact, it would be safe to assert that there is no one series of books
containing so much material about the North American aborigines as
these annual reports.

The present index had its origin some years ago when, on my arrival
in America, I frequently had occasion to use the annual reports. Out
of the vast amount of material contained in some 30,000 pages it was
often extremely difficult, if not altogether impossible, to find
any particular item. To save time and trouble I collected certain
references to subjects in which I was interested. It then occurred to
me that a general index to the reports might be useful to others too,
and on my suggesting the matter to the Chief of the Bureau of American
Ethnology it met with his approval. So what began as a mere handful of
references of a very special nature has ended in being a general index.

Originally it was my intention to include only those volumes which were
published during the first 50 years of the existence of the bureau, but
owing to technical and other difficulties it was found advisable to
publish my “Index” as the accompanying paper to the Forty-eighth Annual
Report. Therefore, after my whole manuscript was prepared and ready for
the press, I included in it the report for the fifty-first year of the
bureau. Moreover, owing to the portly proportions this work has already
assumed, my former plan of including an index to illustrations had
to be abandoned. I hope, however, to be able to publish this at some
future date.

It is my pleasant duty to thank, first of all, the Chief of the Bureau
of American Ethnology, Mr. Matthew W. Stirling, for allowing this paper
to be published in the series of annual reports, and for the uniformly
courteous treatment I have received from him.

Dr. Truman Michelson and Dr. John R. Swanton, both of the same bureau,
have very kindly given me the benefit of their wide experience, and
have offered me many valuable hints on how an index may be of the
utmost value to its user. I take this opportunity of expressing my
gratitude to them; but I wish it to be understood that they are in no
way responsible for any mistakes I may have made.

I also must not forget to express my genuine appreciation of the
excellent indexing work of Mrs. Frances S. Nichols, without which my
labor would have been considerably increased. For indexing the reports
of the last few years I have done very little except to classify
and rearrange the work of Mrs. Nichols, with slight additions and
alterations here and there in order to obtain uniformity for the whole
work.

I also wish to thank all the officials of the Bureau of American
Ethnology with whom I came in contact during my frequent visits to that
institution for their unfailing courtesy and willing cooperation.

LIST OF ANNUAL REPORTS OF THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY WITH AN
INDEX TO AUTHORS AND TITLES AND AN INTRODUCTORY NOTE




INTRODUCTORY NOTE


The importance of conducting ethnological research among the North
American Indians was recognized by the United States Government as
early as 1795, when Leonard S. Shaw was appointed deputy agent among
the Cherokee, and was instructed by the then Secretary of War to study
their language and home life and to collect materials for an Indian
history. The Lewis and Clark expedition of 1804-1806 was planned by
President Jefferson, who expressly instructed the members of the
expedition to collect ethnological data on the Indians. During much
of his life Jefferson manifested a deep interest in the ethnology of
the American tribes and contributed many papers on them which are
of scientific value even to-day. In 1820 Rev. Jedidiah Morse was
commissioned to ascertain for the use of the Government “the actual
state of the Indian tribes” of America. Schoolcraft’s works on the
Indian tribes were aided by the Government; the War Department had made
many expeditions and surveys in the West, and had published papers
relating to the western districts; the cliff dwellings, pueblos, and
tribes of the Mississippi Valley had been described by the Hayden
survey; Maj. J. W. Powell, as chief of the United States Geographical
and Geological Survey of the Rocky Mountain region, had studied and
published his results on the tribes of the Rio Colorado region; but as
yet no systematic research had commenced.

In 1877 began the publication of a series of ethnologic reports
in quarto form under the title “Contributions to North American
Ethnology.” After the United States Geographical and Geological Survey
of the Rocky Mountain region was merged in the United States Geological
Survey, provisions were made by Congress to continue the ethnologic
researches and publications, and in 1879 the Bureau of Ethnology
was organized and placed under the supervision of the Smithsonian
Institution. Prof. Spencer F. Baird, Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, selected Maj. J. W. Powell as the person most suitable to
be the director of the new bureau.

Since its inception in 1879, the bureau, by the publication of its
annual reports, bulletins, and contributions, and by answering
questions of correspondents relative to Indian tribes, has continually
helped to diffuse knowledge, and to make itself known in every
civilized country in the world.

The strictly scientific results accomplished by the Bureau of
American Ethnology relate to every department of anthropologic
science--somatological, psychological, linguistic, sociologic,
religious, technic, and esthetic--and are embodied principally in
the annual reports, though much of this material is to be found
in the bulletins and contributions. Among the practical results
accomplished are: "(1) A study of the relations, location, and
numbers of the tribes, and their classification into groups or
families, based on affinity in language--a necessary basis for dealing
with the tribes practically or scientifically; (2) a study of the
numerous sociologic, religious, and industrial problems involved, an
acquaintance with which is essential to the intelligent management
of the tribes in adjusting them to the requirements of civilization;
(3) a history of the relations of Indian and white races embodied in
a volume on land cessions; (4) investigation into the physiology,
medical practices, and sanitation of a people who suffer keenly from
imperfect adaptation to the new conditions imposed on them; (5) the
preparation of bibliographies embodying all works relating to the
tribes; (6) a study of their industrial and economic resources;
(7) a study of the antiquities of the country with a view to their
record and preservation; (8) a handbook of the tribes, embodying,
in condensed form, the accumulated information of many years”;[2]
(9) the preservation of texts in aboriginal languages which are fast
disappearing along with the culture to which they belong, and thus
providing students and those engaged in commercial enterprises with
the means of acquiring these languages; and (10) the publication of a
series of handbooks on tribes of different geographical areas compiled
and collated by the highest available authorities.

Mexico, Washington, 1907, Vol. I, p. 173 (Bull. 30, Bur. Amer.
Ethn.).]

Maj. J. W. Powell, the director and founder of the Bureau of American
Ethnology, died September 23, 1902, and on October 11 of the same
year Mr. W. H. Holmes was appointed to succeed him, with the title
of “chief of the bureau.” Mr. Holmes remained in office for nearly 9
years. On January 1, 1910, he severed his official connection with the
bureau in order to resume his place as head curator of anthropology in
the United States National Museum, and to become the curator of the
National Gallery of Art. Mr. F. W. Hodge was designated to assume the
administration of the bureau under the title “ethnologist in charge,”
which position he occupied until March 1, 1918. On that day Mr. Hodge
resigned in order to accept a position in the Museum of the American
Indian (Heye Foundation), and Dr. J. Walter Fewkes was appointed
chief of the bureau. Doctor Fewkes continued in office until January
15, 1928, when, shortly before his death, he retired. Mr. Matthew W.
Stirling, the present chief, entered upon his duties as chief of the
Bureau of American Ethnology on August 1, 1928. In addition to the
chief, the scientific staff of the bureau comprises, in 1931, seven
ethnologists, viz., Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, Mr. J. P. Harrington, Dr.
Truman Michelson, Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, jr., Dr. W. D. Strong, Dr.
John R. Swanton, and Dr. W. M. Walker. Besides the seven ethnologists
there are numerous others who are not directly connected with the
bureau, but who contribute or have contributed from time to time to the
annual reports. These may be classed as collaborators and contributors.
The collaborator of the bureau is Miss Frances Densmore, whose special
field of study is Indian music. The contributors[3] are: Martha
Warren Beckwith, Franz Boas, Biren Bonnerjea, John G. Bourke, Ruth L.
Bunzel, Stewart Culin, Jeremiah Curtin, Frank H. Cushing, William H.
Dall, Edwin Thompson Denig, Frances Densmore, J. Owen Dorsey, Jesse

[Footnote 3: Contributors whose papers have appeared in the Annual
Reports.]

The first annual report for the fiscal year 1879-80 was published in
royal octavo form, and since then one annual report has been published
for each fiscal year, except for the fiscal years 1919-1924, for which
only one volume was issued (forty-first annual report), and they
are all in royal octavo form. Until 1895 the reports were specially
authorized by Congress, usually through concurrent resolutions, but
since that date they have been issued under authority of the public
printing law, approved January 12, 1895. At the close of the fiscal
year 1930 forty-six annual reports have appeared (the fourteenth,
seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, twenty-second, and thirty-fifth,
each in two parts or volumes), in all 52 volumes. The forty-seventh
annual report (included in the index volume) is in the final proof
form, and the forty-eighth annual report (general index) is in
preparation.

The present (1931) maximum edition of the annual reports is 4,204,
not including a few copies, generally between 100 and 500, ordered
by the Superintendent of Documents for sale. Of the 4,204 copies the
Bureau of American Ethnology receives 3,500 copies; the remaining 704
copies are distributed to Government libraries, etc. The quota (3,500
copies) allowed to the bureau is distributed free of charge, mainly to
libraries and institutions of learning, and to collaborators and others
engaged in anthropological research or in instruction. Nearly all
annual reports are out of print.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
